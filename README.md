# Casualty Rescue Transport and Treament Model

This model explores the impact on casualty survivability and its relation speed of emergency services folowing a volcanic eruption in La Soufriere, Gudaloupe. Due to various number of parameters affecting the rescue operation, the best method to optimize the rescue operation is by testing different conditions such as number of medically equipped vehicles, queuing lengths at hospitals due to overloading etc. This model achieves this by using Agent Based Modelling to investigate how the interaction of agents vary with the change in parameters.
