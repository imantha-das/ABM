# Casualty Rescue Transport and Treament Model

This model explores the impact on casualty survivability and its relation to the mobilization of  emergency services, folowing a volcanic eruption in La Soufriere, Gudaloupe. Due to diverse variety of parameters affecting rescue operation, the most desirable method to examine the effects of these parameters on the  rescue operation is through different scenario testing. This is achieved by using Agent Based Modelling where different conditions such as availability medically equipped vehicles, staff and quipment at hospitals administer care to casualties, transportation vulnerability etc are tested on autonomous agents.
